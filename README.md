# NAVanalysis
Normalized Additional Velocity analysis (Release 1.0.1)

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/469982786.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/469982786)

Code by Davi Rodrigues (UFES) and Alejandro Hernandez-Arboleda (UFES).

This code is devoted to study the non-baryonic, or non-Newtonian, contribution to galaxy rotation curves straight from a given data sample. Conclusions on the radial profile of a given model can be drawn without individual galaxy fits. Comparisons between different approaches and models can be done with this code. It has started to be developed together with the paper [2204.03762](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03762).

# Files and folders explanation

* `NAVbaseCode.wl` is a package written in Wolfram Language that contains the core definitions for the execution of `NAVanalysis`.
* `NAVobservational.wl` executes the NAV method on the observational data and exports the results.
* `NAVanalysis.nb` is the main file that executes the NAV analysis considering different models (NFW, Burkert, Arctan, DC14 and MOND), for Mathematica notebook.
* `NAVanalysis.wl` is the same as above, but written in plain text. It can be run on Jupyter, VS Code or from the command line (with Wolfram Engine).
* `NAVauxiliaryFunctions.wl` contains new definitions that builds on `NAVbaseCode` and that aims on simplifying the use of `NAVanalysis`.
* `NAVoptions.wl` is a set of options mainly devoted for the plots.
* `ExportTables.wl` is a simple piece of code that converts the `.m` files in the `AuxiliaryData` folder into the `.tsv` files in the `Output` folder. The latter are human readable and easy to be manipulated from different apps and codes. 

* `AuxiliaryData` folder: 
  * `*.m` files: plain text files to be read by Mathematica. They contain the best fit results as generated by [MAGMA](https://github.com/davi-rodrigues/MAGMA) for 153 galaxies and for different models. 
  * `MDC14aux.mx` binary file to speed up the execution of the DC14 analysis. If this file is deleted, or if it cannot be read, it will be generated by NAVanalysis when necessary.
  * `SPARC_Rotmod` sulbolder: the observational data from the SPARC data sample of galaxies was inserted here. We are providing these data for easy of use. The original data can be found [here](http://astroweb.cwru.edu/SPARC/) and they do not constitute part of `NAVanalysis`.

* `Output` folder: it contains data and plot files that were generated by this code.

* `LICENSE` is file with the standard MIT license details that applies to this code.

# Other packages

* Some of the plots require the [CustomTicks package](https://github.com/mark-caprio/CustomTicks), it can be freely downloaded and used.
* [MAGMA](https://github.com/davi-rodrigues/MAGMA) is helpful to generate new galaxy fit results, but it is not necessary to run NAVanalysis: the relevant MAGMA output is provided in the `AuxiliaryData` folder.
